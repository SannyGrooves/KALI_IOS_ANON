Kali Linux Installation Guide for iSH on iOS
This guide explains how to install Kali Linux in text mode on an iOS device using the iSH terminal emulator. It sets up a user-friendly menu with 20 powerful, command-line-compatible Kali Linux tools, featuring an "ANONYMOUS (Community Tools)" ASCII logo. The menu allows you to select tools by number (1–20), view help with ?, or exit with 0. This setup is optimized for iSH’s limitations, ensuring compatibility with iOS’s restricted environment.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

iSH App: Download from the App Store.
iOS Device: Running iOS 12 or later with at least 7 GB of free storage.
Internet: Stable WiFi connection for downloading the Kali Linux root filesystem and tools.
Basic Tools: Familiarity with terminal commands (e.g., cd, chmod) is helpful but not required.

Overview
The installation uses an install.sh script to:

Set up a Kali Linux environment in iSH.
Install 20 tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Aircrack-ng, Sqlmap, Hydra, John, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nikto, Kismet, Hashcat, Dirb, W3af, Netcat, Hping3, Recon-ng, SET, Maltego, Snmpcheck, XSSPY.
Create a menu with the ANONYMOUS logo, categorized tools, and a help system.
Check compatibility for iSH’s text-only, emulated environment.

Step-by-Step Installation
Step 1: Install iSH

Open the App Store on your iOS device (iPhone or iPad).
Search for iSH Shell and install it (direct link).
Launch iSH to access an Alpine Linux shell. You’ll see a command prompt like localhost:~$.

Step 2: Check Storage

In iSH, check available storage to ensure you have at least 7 GB free:df -h /


Look at the “Avail” column in the output. If it shows less than 7 GB (e.g., 4.0G), free up space on your iOS device by deleting unused apps or files, then recheck.

Step 3: Obtain the install.sh Script
The install.sh script automates the setup. You can create it manually in iSH, transfer it from another device, or host it online (e.g., on GitHub).
Option 1: Create Manually in iSH

Open iSH and create the script using a text editor like vi or nano:vi install.sh


Press i to enter insert mode in vi.
Copy the install.sh script from the source (provided separately or from a trusted repository). The script starts with #!/bin/sh and ends with installation instructions.
Paste the script into the terminal.
Save and exit:
For vi: Press Esc, type :wq, and press Enter.
For nano (if preferred):
Install nano: apk add nano
Run: nano install.sh
Paste the script, press Ctrl+O, Enter to save, then Ctrl+X to exit.





Option 2: Transfer from Another Device

On a computer, copy the install.sh script into a text file named install.sh using a text editor (e.g., Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or VS Code).
Transfer the file to your iOS device:
iCloud Drive: Save to iCloud, then access in iSH at /mnt/icloud.
Dropbox/Google Drive: Download via a file-sharing app, then move to a directory iSH can access (e.g., /mnt).
SFTP/SCP: If you have an SSH server, transfer the file to iSH using scp or sftp.


In iSH, navigate to the file’s location:cd /mnt
ls

Verify install.sh is present.

Option 3: Download from GitHub

Host the install.sh script in a GitHub repository:
Create a GitHub account at github.com.
Create a new repository (e.g., “kali-ios-install”).
Upload install.sh to the repository.
Get the raw URL (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/kali-ios-install/main/install.sh).


In iSH, download the script:wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/kali-ios-install/main/install.sh



Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Navigate to the directory containing install.sh (e.g., /mnt or ~):cd /mnt


Set executable permissions:chmod +x install.sh



Step 5: Run the Script

Execute the script:./install.sh


The script performs the following:
Checks iSH Environment: Ensures you’re running in iSH.
Verifies Storage: Confirms ~7 GB free space.
Creates Directory: Sets up /mnt/kali for installation.
Downloads Root Filesystem: Fetches Kali Linux 2025.2 from kali.org.
Extracts Filesystem: Unpacks the rootfs (iSH may crash; see Troubleshooting).
Downloads kali.sh: Gets the startup script from kali-ios GitHub.
Adds Menu: Appends a user-friendly menu with the ANONYMOUS logo, 20 tools grouped by category (Network, Wireless, Web, Password, Exploitation, Recon), and a help system.
Installs Tools: Installs 20 CLI-compatible tools and dependencies (python3, pip3).
Optimizes Display: Prompts you to set iSH font size to 9.
Provides Instructions: Explains how to start the Kali environment.



Step 6: Optimize iSH Display

As prompted, set the iSH font size to 9 for optimal menu display:
Open iSH Settings (tap the gear icon or go to iOS Settings > iSH).
Navigate to Appearance > Font Size and set to 9.


This ensures the ANONYMOUS ASCII logo and menu align properly.

Step 7: Launch Kali Linux and Use the Menu

Navigate to the installation directory:cd /mnt/kali


Start the Kali environment:./kali.sh


The menu displays:
The “ANONYMOUS (Community Tools)” ASCII logo.
20 tools in categories: Network Analysis, Wireless Tools, Web Application Testing, Password Cracking, Exploitation, Reconnaissance.
Instructions to select a tool (1–20), type ? for help, or 0 to exit.


Using the Menu:
Select a Tool: Enter a number (1–20) to choose a tool (e.g., 1 for Nmap). Confirm with y or Y when prompted, or press any other key to cancel. After the tool runs, press Enter to return to the menu.
Help Menu: Type ? to view usage examples, iSH compatibility notes, and tool descriptions. Press Enter to return.
Exit: Type 0 to exit to the shell.

Troubleshooting

iSH Crashes During Extraction:
The kali-ios project notes this is normal due to memory constraints.
Relaunch iSH, navigate to /mnt/kali, and run:cd /mnt/kali
./kali.sh




Tool Installation Fails:
If a tool fails to install, enter the Kali environment (./kali.sh) and run:sudo apt update
sudo apt install <tool-name>

Example: sudo apt install nmap.


Network Issues:
Ensure a stable WiFi connection. If downloads fail, verify the KALI_ROOTFS_URL in install.sh matches the latest Kali image at kali.org/get-kali.


Tool Limitations:
Wireless Tools (aircrack-ng, kismet): Limited by iOS’s lack of raw WiFi access. The menu warns about this.
Performance (hashcat, metasploit): Slow due to iSH’s usermode x86 emulation.
Manual Setup (burpsuite, maltego): Require additional configuration; check the help menu (?) for CLI instructions.


Menu Display Issues:
If the logo or menu is misaligned, set iSH font size to 9 in Settings > Appearance.


Support:
Visit the kali-ios GitHub for issues.
Contact: mewl.team@outlook.com.



Compatibility Notes

iSH Environment:
Runs Alpine Linux with usermode x86 emulation, supporting only text-based tools.
No GUI support; tools like Wireshark use tshark, W3af uses w3af_console.
iOS restricts raw network access, limiting aircrack-ng, kismet, and hping3.


Tools:
All 20 tools are CLI-compatible, verified via kali-ios and Kali tools documentation.
The script checks tool installation and displays warnings for limited functionality.


Storage: Requires ~7 GB, checked by the script to prevent failures.

Legal and Ethical Use

Kali Linux is designed for security professionals and ethical hackers.
Use these tools only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test, per Kali’s ethical guidelines.
Unauthorized use may violate laws or terms of service.
